This was a project I did in my free time in an attempt to test my coding skills.
However, I ultimately only ended up getting as far as my sudoku skills would get me.
I might come back to this later when I'm ready to put more time into solving sudoku puzzles.

You can use the hi.txt file as sample input for the program, although compilation is still necessary for the .cpp and .h files.
